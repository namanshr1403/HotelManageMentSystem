<h3>HotelManagementSystem</h3>
The Hotel Management System is a comprehensive application designed to streamline hotel operations, offering a suite of features that facilitate seamless management of rooms, reservations, user authentication, and additional services such as cab pickups. Built with Java, JDBC, and MySQL in NetBeans IDE, the system ensures a robust backend and an intuitive interface for hotel administrators and users alike.

Key Features
<h3> User Authentication and Authorization</h3>
The system includes secure authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized access, allowing only verified users to log in.
Role-based permissions ensure that different users (e.g., admin, staff, and guests) can access only the features relevant to their roles, maintaining data integrity and security.
<h3> Database Design</h3>
The application is backed by a well-structured MySQL database with relational designs that define clear links between entities such as customers, rooms, reservations, and staff.
This relational design supports efficient querying and data management, enhancing system performance and reliability.

<h3>Room Status and Availability</h3>

A central feature of the system is the ability to track room availability in real time. Room status is updated dynamically based on check-in and check-out activity, ensuring accurate availability display for new bookings.
This mechanism helps the hotel staff avoid double bookings and improves operational efficiency.
<h3> Cab Pickup Service Integration </h3>

The system integrates with external cab pickup services, providing users with the option to book transportation conveniently.
Secure protocols are in place to handle external service data, ensuring a safe, reliable, and convenient experience for guests.
<h3>Room Search and Filtering</h3>

Guests and administrators can use search and filtering options to find rooms based on criteria such as bed type, room type, price range, and availability.
This feature makes it easy for users to find accommodations that meet their preferences and budget, enhancing the booking experience.
<h3> Reservation and Booking Management</h3>

Users can make reservations, which are automatically logged in the system, updating room availability and maintaining a record of guest history.
Reservation modifications, cancellations, and extensions are handled efficiently, allowing smooth adjustments to bookings.
